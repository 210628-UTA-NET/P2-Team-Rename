# TutorConnect

## Overview
Education has become a necessity in today’s high-skill, high-tech economy. Online classes and/or education are becoming more mainstream, but these methods lack the kind of one-on-one attention that many students require to succeed. As such it is TutorConnect’s goal to connect tutors with students.
